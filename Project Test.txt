Information about the test.

The test is based on the Upwork project. The Upwork project is the creation a user interface that has similarities with an existing Windows application. Please note the project is concerned with the User Interface not the api data manipulation.
Please use the Windows application as a guide, you are free use your own inititive and creativity for the user interface layout. For the actual job you will be given feedback on the implementation and questions can be asked with regards to userface usage.

For the test work we will look at your work with the sys-sitem-all-fields entity. Please find screen shots of the interface in the Windows application here
https://iis001.internal.freeflowhub.com.au:31100/svn/ffh_client_main_ui/sys-sitem-all-fields-win-app

For the project work the Windows application will be installed rather than utilising screen shots.

Some of the interface for the sys-sitem-all-fields has been done, your task for the test is to complete this interface. That is give it the same functionality as the Windows app shown in the screen shots.

When you a done committ your work area to the svn server.
